# Contoso Marketplace: Retail Performance & Microsoft 365 Copilot Demo Guide

## Setting the Scene

You are the retail manager at **Contoso Marketplace**, a national Australian omnichannel retailer operating physical stores and digital sales across **Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide**.

The company has invested in:
* Online shopping
* Click & Collect
* Loyalty programmes
* Seasonal and weekend promotions
* A broad product portfolio covering fashion, beauty, electronics, and home products

Contoso Marketplace has recorded strong sales growth, but management wants to understand whether it represents healthy, profitable growth. Revenue alone does not tell the full story. Some channels and product categories may be generating significant sales while delivering weaker margins or lower customer satisfaction.

The leadership team is encouraged by revenue growth but wants to ensure it is profitable, sustainable, and supported by a consistently good customer experience. As they prepare for their quarterly business review (QBR), they need answers to several questions:
* What is driving the growth in sales and profit?
* Which regions, stores, channels, and categories are performing best?
* Where is revenue growing at the expense of margin?
* Are promotions and discounts producing profitable incremental sales?
* Could customer satisfaction issues threaten future growth?
* Where should the company focus its investment and management attention next?

## Dataset Overview (`Copilot_Retail_Sales_Demo.xlsx`)

You have been given a synthetic retail transaction workbook (`Copilot_Retail_Sales_Demo.xlsx`) containing:
* **720 transactions** across 2024 and 2025
* **Five regions:** Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide
* **Ten stores**
* **Three channels:** Online, In-store, and Click & Collect
* **Five merchandise categories:** Apparel, Beauty, Electronics, Footwear, and Home
* **Context & Metrics:** Product, customer segment, promotional information, commercial measures (units, sales, cost, profit, margin), and a customer satisfaction score for every transaction.

The workbook connects four parts of retail performance:
1. **What was sold:** Category, Product, and Units
2. **Where and how it was sold:** Region, Store, and Channel
3. **Financial outcome:** Net Sales, COGS, Profit, and Margin
4. **Customer and promotional context:** Customer Segment, Promotion, Discount, and Satisfaction

## Business Objectives & Management Tension

The Retail Director has asked the management team to prepare for the quarterly business review by answering five practical questions:
1. Are sales and profit growing?
2. Which regions, stores, categories, and channels are driving growth?
3. Are promotions producing profitable sales, or merely discounting revenue?
4. Where are margin or customer-experience problems emerging?
5. Where should management place inventory, marketing, and operational attention?

### The Central Question
> **How can Contoso Marketplace continue growing without sacrificing profitability or customer experience?**

### Starting Hypotheses
* Sales have grown strongly, but margin has not increased at the same rate as revenue.
* Online is the largest sales channel, but its customer satisfaction result warrants investigation.
* Click & Collect is currently smaller but produces an attractive combination of margin and satisfaction.
* Electronics generates substantial revenue but has weaker margins than other categories.
* Peak promotional periods produce strong sales, but those sales may come with a profitability trade-off.

*(Note: Treat these as starting hypotheses. Your analysis must validate them, challenge them where appropriate, and identify the most credible management actions.)*

## Demo Execution & Learner Challenge

### Suggested Opening Script
> “Contoso Marketplace has delivered strong sales growth across its Australian retail network. However, the leadership team is concerned that revenue growth may be masking differences in profitability, promotional effectiveness, and customer experience.
> 
> We have been asked to prepare for the quarterly business review. We need to determine which parts of the business are driving profitable growth, which areas require intervention, and where Contoso Marketplace should invest next.
> 
> We’ll begin in Excel by asking Copilot to explain the workbook and identify the most important measures. We’ll then move from descriptive analysis into deeper investigation with the Analyst agent. Finally, we’ll convert our findings into a Word management report and an executive PowerPoint presentation.
> 
> The goal isn’t simply to produce charts. It is to turn retail data into a clear, evidence-based management recommendation.”

### Learner Challenge
By the end of the activity, learners should be able to answer:
> **If you were the Retail Director, what three decisions would you make based on this data, and what evidence supports each decision?**

### Connected Microsoft 365 Workflow
1. **Excel:** Analyse the retail transactions and build an executive dashboard.
2. **Analyst Agent:** Investigate the drivers behind sales, margin, and satisfaction.
3. **Word:** Convert the findings into a management performance report.
4. **PowerPoint:** Transform the Word report into a concise executive presentation.

## Key Findings & Business Pain Points

*Extracted from the spreadsheet—treat these as signals that warrant investigation rather than proof of causation.*

### 1. Growth is strong, but margin has softened
* Net sales increased from ~$136,327 in 2024 to ~$181,048 in 2025 (+32.8%).
* Profit increased from ~$57,371 to ~$75,063.
* Margin declined slightly from ~42.1% to ~41.5%.
* **Pain point:** Contoso Marketplace may be growing revenue faster than margin. Management needs to understand whether the change comes from category mix, channel mix, discounting, or cost pressure.

### 2. Online is the largest channel, but customer satisfaction is lower
* Online produced ~$157,644 in net sales (largest channel).
* Online satisfaction averaged ~3.99, compared with ~4.15 for In-store and ~4.14 for Click & Collect.
* Online margin was ~40.9%, below Click & Collect at ~44.5%.
* **Pain point:** Online growth may be introducing fulfilment, service, usability, or delivery issues.

### 3. Click & Collect appears underdeveloped
* Click & Collect generated ~$37,463 (considerably less than Online and In-store).
* Delivered the highest channel margin (~44.5%) and strong satisfaction (~4.14).
* **Opportunity:** Click & Collect could be a profitable growth channel if Contoso can increase awareness, availability, and adoption without damaging service levels.

### 4. Electronics generates substantial revenue but weak margin
* Generated ~$84,465 in sales (second-highest category), but margin was ~29.0% (lowest category margin).
* By comparison: Beauty (~59.9%), Apparel (~47.6%), Home (~44.5%), and Footwear (~41.6%).
* **Pain point:** Electronics may suffer from high product cost, competitive pricing pressure, unfavourable product mix, or excessive discounting.

### 5. December delivers peak volume but weaker profitability
* December generated ~$45,884 in sales (strongest month), but margin was ~39.1% (below the 41.7% overall average).
* **Pain point:** Peak-season sales may come with a margin trade-off. Examine seasonal promotions, category mix, and fulfilment costs before repeating the campaign structure.

### 6. Promotional performance is not clearly differentiated
* Transactions with no named promotion generated ~$146,221 in sales (~42.1% margin), whereas named promotions generally produced margins around 41.3% to 41.8%.
* **Pain point:** Promotions may support volume, but lack a major margin advantage. Assess incremental sales rather than just top-line revenue during promotions.

### 7. Store performance is inconsistent
* **Pitt Street:** Highest-sales store (~$51,452).
* **Chadstone:** ~$46,771 sales, ~39.8% margin, ~3.97 satisfaction.
* **Melbourne Central:** ~$41,177 sales, ~44.3% margin, ~4.10 satisfaction.
* **Pain point:** Stores with similar commercial importance produce noticeably different profitability and customer outcomes.

## Copilot Prompts for the Analyst Agent

*The Analyst agent is best demonstrated with an open-ended business question requiring several analytical steps, rather than a simple calculation.*

### Primary Analyst Prompt
> Act as a senior retail performance analyst for Contoso Marketplace. Analyse the attached retail sales workbook and determine what is driving the change in sales and profit between 2024 and 2025. Investigate performance by month, region, store, channel, category, product, customer segment, promotion and discount level.
> 
> Specifically:
> * Quantify the year-over-year changes in sales, profit, units, margin and satisfaction.
> * Identify the largest positive and negative contributors.
> * Investigate why margin did not grow at the same rate as sales.
> * Examine whether promotions and discounts are producing profitable growth.
> * Identify possible customer-experience risks.
> * Highlight anomalies or results that require validation.
> * Recommend five management actions, supported by evidence.
> 
> Clearly distinguish findings supported by the data from hypotheses requiring additional information. Present the results as an executive summary followed by detailed supporting analysis.

### Useful Analyst Follow-Ups
* **Driver analysis:** Decompose the 2025 sales increase into volume, product mix, category mix, channel mix and regional contribution. Explain which drivers had the greatest effect.
* **Margin investigation:** Investigate the difference between revenue growth and margin performance. Identify the categories, products, channels and promotions that contributed most to margin dilution.
* **Customer experience:** Analyse the relationship between Satisfaction and Channel, Store, Promotion, Discount, Product and Customer Segment. Identify statistically meaningful patterns and avoid claiming causation.
* **Anomaly detection:** Find unusual transactions or groups with unexpected combinations of high sales, low margin, high discount or low satisfaction. Explain why each anomaly deserves investigation.
* **Scenario analysis:** Model three scenarios for the next period: continue the current mix, increase Click & Collect sales by 20%, and shift 5% of Electronics sales toward Apparel and Beauty. Estimate the potential revenue, profit and margin implications and document every assumption.
