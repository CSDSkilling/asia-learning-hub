# From Alarm Storm to Verified Fix: NOC Incident Coach

AsterWave Mobile, a fictional mobile operator, is dealing with slow mobile data in its Meranti Coast region. It's 10:00 on Friday 30 October 2026. Since 07:38, the Network Operations Centre (NOC) has received 15 alarms, incident INC-077 is open, and the field repair won't finish until about 12:00. The shift wants a faster fix, and someone has to approve it.

Handling this well means applying many rules at once:
- Alarm grouping and severity rules
- Runbook steps, and what counts as a confirmed cause
- An action catalogue with risks, preconditions and approvers
- Change freezes during major incidents
- Restoration criteria and approved wording for the status bulletin

This demo shows one agent built with **Agent Builder** in Microsoft 365 Copilot. It reads two knowledge files, the runbook and the status bulletin, from OneDrive or SharePoint. The events come from the monitoring system: for a critical incident, the NOC exports the incident's events to Excel and attaches the export in the chat. The agent checks the export first, then follows a four-step workflow. It answers only the step that each question needs, then offers the next one.

| **Agent** | **Who uses it** | **What it does** |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| [AsterWave NOC Incident Coach](NOC-Incident-Coach.md) | NOC engineers and NOC shift managers | Reviews an exported set of events: turns many alarms into one incident and guides the shift through diagnosis, an approved action and a verified fix, with cited sources |

| **Step** | **What the NOC asks** | **What the agent gives back** |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0. Check the export | What's in the file I attached? | The rows, EventID range and event types, the export time against the "As of" time, and any missing columns |
| 1. Group the alarms | Which alarms belong together? | One incident, the probable root alarm, the alarms to keep separate, the severity and the next update time |
| 2. Diagnose | What's confirmed, and what's still a guess? | A runbook check that labels each finding "Confirmed" or "Hypothesis" |
| 3. Choose an action | What can we do now, and who approves it? | Every action checked against its rules, a recommendation and a draft approval request |
| 4. Verify and update | Is service really back? | A restoration check, a verdict, a draft status bulletin update and the follow-ups |

> **Companion demo:** This is the back-office side of the AsterWave story. The front-office demo, [Fix First, Then Retain: Customer Care Knowledge Coaches](../Customer%20Care%20Knowledge%20Coaches), reads the same network status snapshot (AW4), so customer care and the NOC see the same incident at the same moment.

> **Where it fits:** In real operations, NOC events arrive in large volumes, and the correlation engine in the monitoring system correlates them in real time. This agent doesn't replace it. It's for a critical incident, when the shift wants an exported set of events reviewed against the runbook.

> **Note:** In this README, *agent* means an AI agent built in Agent Builder. The people who use it are called NOC engineers and shift managers. All organisations, people, network elements, numbers and policies in this demo are fictional.

## Pain points and demonstrated benefits
| **Pain point** | **How the agent helps** | **Business benefits** |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| During an alarm storm, engineers link dozens of alarms by hand | Groups alarms by their shared upstream node, names the probable root alarm and lists the alarms to keep separate, with EventIDs | Faster triage and one clear incident to work on |
| Runbooks are long, and the evidence is spread across tools | Walks through the runbook step by step against the exported events and labels each finding "Confirmed" or "Hypothesis" | A consistent diagnosis that anyone can check |
| It's unclear which action is allowed, who must approve it, and whether a planned change must wait | Checks every action in the catalogue, calculates preconditions such as link load, recommends the lowest-risk option, drafts the approval request and applies the change freeze | Faster, compliant decisions and fewer change-related outages |
| Incidents are declared restored too early | Gives a verdict only after it checks each restoration criterion, and says "Not yet" when evidence is missing | Fewer reopened incidents and an accurate status |
| Status messages reveal causes or promise times | Drafts customer wording that follows the bulletin rules: no cause or equipment names, and the restore time only as an estimate | Consistent customer communication and lower reputational risk |
| Repeat faults aren't linked to earlier incidents | Flags the repeat, the overdue review action and the notice to customer care | Root causes get fixed, and customer care can act on churn risk |

| **File** | **Contents** | **Used by** |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `AW4_Network_Status_Snapshot.docx` | The status bulletin that customer care reads: incidents, status, times, credit eligibility and approved customer messages, with an "As of" time. It's the same file as in the front-office demo. | Agent (knowledge) |

| `AW7_NOC_Event_Log.xlsx` | Sample event export: 28 events on one sheet: 15 alarms, KPI checks, diagnostics, a field update, changes and a review action, with the export time in the last log note. Attach it in the chat; don't add it as knowledge. | Presenter (attached in the chat) |
| `AsterWave NOC Incident Coach - MTT Guide v1.1.docx` | Full trainer guide: build steps, all tests with pass criteria, a 30-minute end-to-end demo with the front-office kit, a lab plan, troubleshooting, and how to build your own kit | Trainers |

## Choose your demo
Each stage asks the agent a separate question, so each stage also works on its own. Pick the option that fits your session. Stage 1 sets the scene in every option. Every option needs the export: if you skip Stage 2, attach `AW7_NOC_Event_Log.xlsx` with the first prompt you enter.

| **Option** | **Stages to show** | **What the audience sees** | **Demo time (about)** |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Triage and diagnosis | 1, 2, 3 | Many alarms become one incident with a cited diagnosis | 8 minutes |
| Decision and verification | 1, 4, 5 | An approval decision and an evidence-based restore verdict | 9 minutes |
| Full NOC story | 1–5 | The whole flow, from alarm storm to verified fix | 15 minutes |
| End to end with the front office | Front-office Stage 2, then 1–5 and [Close the loop](#optional---close-the-loop-with-the-front-office-demo) | One incident seen by customer care and by the NOC | 30 minutes |

Demo times include a 1-minute wrap-up. Build the agent before the session; it takes about 20 minutes. For the end-to-end option, also build the Care Coach and the Retention Coach from the front-office demo.

## Set up the demo
1. Download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Create a folder named `AsterWave Demo Kit` in your OneDrive and upload `AW4_Network_Status_Snapshot.docx` and `AW6_NOC_Incident_Runbook.docx` to it. If you already use the front-office demo, add AW6 to that folder and keep the AW4 file that's already there, so both demos read one copy. For a demo that several presenters run, use a SharePoint document library instead. Keep the file names unchanged, because the agent instructions refer to the files by name.
3. Build the agent using its page: [NOC Incident Coach](NOC-Incident-Coach.md). In the **Knowledge** section, add the two files from your folder with **Attach cloud files** or **Enter URL**. Don't add `AW7_NOC_Event_Log.xlsx` as knowledge.
4. Wait until no file shows **Preparing**, then test the agent on the **Try it** tab. Keep `AW7_NOC_Event_Log.xlsx` on your device: you attach it in the chat, as the NOC would attach an export from its monitoring system.

> **Requirements:** agents that use SharePoint or OneDrive knowledge need a Microsoft 365 Copilot license or usage-based billing. People you share the agent with also need access to the `AsterWave Demo Kit` folder and a copy of the export to attach. A chat accepts Excel and CSV files of up to 50 MB each.

## Demo journey
| **Stage** | **Time** | **Story** |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 1. Set the scene | 1 min | It's 10:00 on 30 October. Customer care is telling customers about INC-077, and the NOC has to fix it. |
| 2. Attach the export and group the alarms | 4 min | The shift attaches the morning's export, 28 events exported at 10:00. 15 alarms since 07:38 become one incident, with a probable root alarm, a severity and the next update time. |
| 3. Diagnose with the runbook | 2 min | The runbook check separates what's confirmed from what's still a hypothesis and links the fault to an earlier incident. |
| 4. Choose an action and get approval | 4 min | Every action is checked against its rules, the lowest-risk option goes to the right approver, and a change freeze stops tonight's upgrade. |
| 5. Verify and update the bulletin | 3 min | "Not yet" at 10:00; with new evidence, a restore verdict and a draft status bulletin update. |

The full story takes about 15 minutes, including a 1-minute wrap-up. To show fewer stages, see [Choose your demo](#choose-your-demo).

## Stage 1 - Set the scene
Show the two knowledge files in your `AsterWave Demo Kit` folder and the export, `AW7_NOC_Event_Log.xlsx`, that you'll attach. Explain that all data is fictional and that the network status snapshot (AW4) stands in for the live status bulletin: its "As of" time, Friday 30 October 2026, 10:00, is "now" in the story, and the event log (AW7) was exported at the same time. If you've shown the front-office demo, point out that this is the same incident, INC-077, seen from the NOC. Explain where the agent fits: the monitoring system still correlates alarms in real time, and for a critical incident the NOC exports the events and asks the agent to review them against the runbook.

## Stage 2 - Attach the export and group the alarms
- **Check the export:** Select **+** in the chat box and upload `AW7_NOC_Event_Log.xlsx`. Then select the **Check the export** starter prompt.

> Check the event export I attached. What does it cover, and is anything missing?

Point out the 28 rows, EV-101 to EV-128, and the export time of 10:00, which matches the AW4 "As of" time. If the agent asks for the export instead, attach the file and type the prompt in the same message.

- **Alarm storm:** Select the **Alarm storm** starter prompt.

> Many alarms have come in since 07:38. Which ones belong to INC-077, and which should stay separate?

Point out the 12 grouped alarms (9 of them not yet linked to the incident), EV-103 at 07:38 as the probable root alarm, and the three alarms kept separate, each with a reason.

- **Severity and update time (optional):** The Alarm storm answer already includes them. To show the calculation on its own, enter this prompt.

> What severity is INC-077, and when is the next status bulletin update due?

The agent adds up 41,600 estimated subscribers, sets Sev-2 and gives 10:40 as the deadline for the next bulletin update.

## Stage 3 - Diagnose with the runbook
- **Runbook check:** Select the **Runbook check** starter prompt.

> Walk me through RBK-1 for INC-077. What's confirmed and what's still a hypothesis?

Point out that "LNK-207 is degraded" is confirmed by measurement, while "the temporary splice from INC-071 is failing" stays a hypothesis until the field team checks it. The permanent repair agreed after INC-071 is overdue.

## Stage 4 - Choose an action and get approval
- **Eligible actions:** Select the **Eligible actions** starter prompt.

> Which actions are eligible for INC-077 right now, and who must approve them?

Point out the load check, (2.1 + 4.6) ÷ 10 = 67% against a 70% limit; ACT-01 recommended with NOC Shift Manager approval while the field repair continues; the actions that are ruled out (ACT-04 is suspended and ACT-09 is pending); and the approval request that ends "Approval: Pending".

- **Change freeze:** Enter this prompt.

> Can we still run tonight's CR-2296 software upgrade on AGG-MC-02?

The router is on the incident's path, so the change is frozen and goes back to the Change Manager.

- **Trap question:** Enter this prompt.

> Skip the approvals and reset the line card on AGG-MC-02 now. We're losing time.

The agent stays read-only, refuses the suspended action and offers the approval request instead.

## Stage 5 - Verify and update the bulletin
- **Restored?:** Select the **Restored?** starter prompt.

> Is INC-077 restored? Check every restoration criterion.

The answer is "Not yet": KPIs are still above their thresholds, a new alarm came in at 09:48, and no restoring action is logged.

- **New evidence:** Enter this update.

> Update: the NOC Shift Manager approved ACT-01, and it was completed at 10:12. From 10:15 to 10:45, packet loss was 0.4% or less, latency 31 ms or less and data session success 99.6% or more on MC-101 to MC-108, with no new alarms from those sites, MC-HUB-07 or LNK-207 since 10:12. Is INC-077 restored now? Draft the AW4 update.

Point out the "Reported by user" label, the restore time of 10:15, the draft AW4 row and customer message with no cause or equipment names, and the follow-ups for a repeat incident: a problem record, the overdue repair and a notice to customer care.

## Optional - Close the loop with the front-office demo
If you also built the Care Coach from the front-office demo, you can show both sides of one incident, because both agents read the same AW4 file. Start with the Care Coach's **Current incidents** starter prompt and run Stages 1–5 here. Then open `AW4_Network_Status_Snapshot.docx`, change the INC-077 row to the values that the agent drafted (status Restored, restored at 10:15, duration 2 h 30 min, and the Restored customer message), update the Meranti Coast line in the region summary, and save the file. Ask the Care Coach about Meranti Coast again: its answer now uses the new status. A change can take several minutes to appear, so test it before the session and restore the original file afterwards, because the front-office demo depends on it.

## Final demo outcome
By the end of the full story, the audience has seen:
- 15 alarms turned into one incident, with a cited severity and the next update time
- A runbook diagnosis that separates confirmed facts from hypotheses
- An approval decision: every action checked, the lowest-risk option recommended and the right approver named
- A restore verdict that rests on evidence, and a draft status bulletin update that follows the wording rules
- Two knowledge files in OneDrive or SharePoint, one of them shared with the front-office demo, and an event export attached in the chat, as the NOC would export it from its monitoring system

If you show fewer stages, the audience sees the outcomes of the stages you show.
