# Fix First, Then Retain: Customer Care Knowledge Coaches

AsterWave Mobile, a fictional mobile operator, is dealing with slow mobile data in its Meranti Coast region. Customer CUS-01042 contacts care for the second time this month (case CARE-2048) and mentions a competitor.

Handling this well means applying many rules at once:
- Plans, roaming and eSIM rules
- Billing adjustments and authority limits
- Current network incidents and approved outage wording
- Service credits and retention offer eligibility
- Rules for vulnerable customers and escalation

This demo shows three agents built with **Agent Builder** in Microsoft 365 Copilot. All three read the same five knowledge files from OneDrive or SharePoint, but each one has different instructions.

| **Agent** | **Who uses it** | **What it does** |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| [AsterWave Care Coach](Care-Coach.md) | Frontline care agents | Fixes the customer's immediate problem with a short, cited answer card |
| [AsterWave Retention Coach](Retention-Coach.md) | Retention specialists and team leads | Fixes the problem first, checks every retention offer against the rules, and drafts a hand-off note |
| [AsterWave Onboarding Coach](Onboarding-Coach.md) | New agents and trainers | Teaches the same rules through lessons, quizzes and role-plays |

> All organisations, people, plans, prices, offers and policies in this demo are fictional.

## Pain points and demonstrated benefits
| **Pain point** | **How the agents help** | **Business benefits** |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Agents search many documents during live calls and give inconsistent answers | The Care Coach answers from the approved files with steps, customer-ready wording and clause-level citations | Faster, consistent answers that anyone can check |
| Outage calls lead to guesses about causes and restore times | The Care Coach reads the network status snapshot and uses the approved customer message | Accurate outage communication and clear expectations |
| Credits and adjustments go beyond authority limits | Every answer states whether approval is needed and who approves | Fewer policy breaches and less rework |
| Retention offers are chosen inconsistently, or invented | The Retention Coach fixes the problem first, checks every offer against the eligibility rules, and recommends the lowest-cost eligible option | Compliant, cost-aware retention decisions |
| Vulnerable customers can be offered unsuitable contracts | The Retention Coach applies the vulnerable-customer rules before any offer | Fair treatment and lower conduct risk |
| New agents take a long time to learn the rules | The Onboarding Coach teaches, quizzes and role-plays, with rubric-based feedback | Faster, safer ramp-up on fictional cases |

## Set up the demo
1. Download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Create a folder named `AsterWave Demo Kit` in your OneDrive and upload the five AW files to it. For a demo that several presenters run, use a SharePoint document library instead. Keep the file names unchanged, because the agent instructions refer to the files by name.
3. Build each agent from its page: [Care Coach](Care-Coach.md), [Retention Coach](Retention-Coach.md) and [Onboarding Coach](Onboarding-Coach.md). In the **Knowledge** section, add the files from your folder with **Attach cloud files** or **Enter URL**.
4. Wait until no file shows **Preparing**, then test each agent on the **Try it** tab.

> **Requirements:** agents that use SharePoint or OneDrive knowledge need a Microsoft 365 Copilot license or usage-based billing. People you share the agents with also need access to the `AsterWave Demo Kit` folder.

## Demo journey
| **Stage** | **Agent** | **Story** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1. Set the scene | — | Customer CUS-01042 in Meranti Coast contacts care a second time about slow data and mentions a competitor. |
| 2. Fix the immediate problem | Care Coach | Check the current incident, offer the right service credit and tell the customer what to expect. |
| 3. Decide on retention | Retention Coach | Fix the problem first, check every offer against the rules, and recommend the lowest-cost eligible option. |
| 4. Hand off for action | — | These agents are read-only by design; recording the action in a system of record is a Copilot Studio scenario. |
| 5. Train new agents | Onboarding Coach | Practise the same case in a role-play and get rubric-based feedback. |

The whole demo takes about 15 minutes.

## Stage 1 - Set the scene
Show the five files in your `AsterWave Demo Kit` folder and introduce customer CUS-01042 and case CARE-2048. Explain that all data is fictional and that the network status snapshot (AW4) stands in for a live system: its "As of" time, Friday 30 October 2026, 10:00, is "now" in the story.

## Stage 2 - Fix the immediate problem with the Care Coach
- **Current incident:** Select the **Current incidents** starter prompt.

> Is there a current incident affecting mobile data in Meranti Coast? What should I tell the customer?

- **Service credit:** Select the **Outage credit** starter prompt.

> What can I offer a Meranti Coast customer affected by INC-077?

Point out the incident status and Last updated time, the SRV-2.1 credit, the approval line, the customer wording and the clause-level sources.

- **Trap question:** Enter this prompt.

> Can you give this customer 50% off for six months?

The agent doesn't invent an offer. It refers the request to the Retention Coach.

## Stage 3 - Decide on retention with the Retention Coach
- **Check eligibility:** Select the **Check eligibility** starter prompt.

> CARE-2048: AW-POST-45, 26 months, out of contract, two contacts about slow data in Meranti Coast in the last 10 days (INC-071 and INC-077). Main reason network quality; mentions a competitor; no retention offer in the last 12 months. Which options are eligible?

Point out "fix first", the eligibility table, the offers that fail and why, OFFER-12 as the recommendation, and the hand-off note.

- **Vulnerable customer:** Select the **Vulnerable customer** starter prompt.

> The CARE-2048 customer has just mentioned financial hardship. How does that change the options?

Offers that need a new contract drop out under VUL-4.2, and the agent adds a payment extension and a referral for a hardship review.

## Stage 4 - Hand off for action
Explain that the agents in this demo are read-only: they explain rules and approvals but never change records. Logging OFFER-12 in a system of record after the specialist confirms it needs actions and workflows, which is a Copilot Studio scenario. An Agent Builder agent can be copied to Copilot Studio when it needs those capabilities.

## Stage 5 - Train new agents with the Onboarding Coach
- **Role-play:** Select the **Outage role-play** starter prompt.

> Role-play a customer whose data has been slow in Meranti Coast since this morning.

Reply twice as the care agent, then enter `end role-play`. Point out the rubric scores and clause citations. This agent uses the same policy files as the other two; only the instructions differ.

## Optional - Show a live status update
Because the agents read the files from OneDrive or SharePoint, you can show changing data. After Stage 2, open `AW4_Network_Status_Snapshot.docx`, change the INC-077 row to **Restored** (and the Meranti Coast line in the region summary), and save it. At the end of the demo, ask the Care Coach about Meranti Coast again. A change can take several minutes to appear, so test it before the session and restore the original file afterwards.

## Final demo outcome
By the end of the demo, the audience has seen:
- Cited answer cards that state approval limits
- A rules-based retention decision with a hand-off note
- Coaching with rubric-based feedback
- One set of knowledge files in OneDrive or SharePoint serving three agents, each shaped by its own instructions
