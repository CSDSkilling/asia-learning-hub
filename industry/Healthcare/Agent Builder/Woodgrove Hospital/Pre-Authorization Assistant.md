# Woodgrove Hospital Pre-Authorization Assistant

## Scenario

Woodgrove Hospital is a 350-bed multi-speciality hospital in India. About 60% of its planned admissions are cashless, and it is empanelled with five payers: four private insurers and TPAs, and one government scheme.

Every payer has its own package rates, document checklist, room-rent cap, co-pay, waiting periods and lead times. This knowledge sits with a few senior insurance desk staff, in old emails and in personal Excel sheets.

On a Friday at 4:00 pm, Dr. Rao advises a planned angioplasty with 2 stents for a 58-year-old patient insured with Fabrikam General Insurance, with admission on Monday at 8:00 am. The senior colleague who knows Fabrikam is on leave. Kavita, the desk executive, needs to know what Fabrikam requires, what the patient will pay, and what could cause a rejection.

The Pre-Authorization Assistant answers these questions in seconds from the hospital's approved insurance documents. It lists the package, rate, lead time, document checklist, patient estimate and likely rejection reasons, and it names the source document for every answer. Approval remains the payer's decision.

## Pain Points and Benefits

| Pain Point | What Happens Today | Benefit with the Assistant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Too many payer rule sets | 8 common packages across 5 payers is 40 rule sets (rates, documents, limits, waiting periods); real hospitals track hundreds | Answers payer and package questions from one set of approved documents |
| Knowledge held by a few people | Rules live in senior staff memory, email threads and personal Excel sheets, so answers differ by desk and shift | One consistent answer, with the source document named |
| Queries cost days | A missing document triggers a query, and each cycle adds 24 to 48 hours while the surgery date is at risk | Gives the full document checklist up front, so requests go in complete |
| Late or wrong requests | Lead times differ by payer (24 to 72 hours); wrong package or stent count is chosen under time pressure | Flags the payer's lead time and matches the package to the procedure |
| Surprise bills for patients | Co-pay, policy limits, room-rent caps and non-payable items surface at discharge | Shows the patient estimate with the arithmetic before admission |
| Avoidable rejections | Waiting periods, diagnostic-only admissions and missing implant stickers are found after submission | Warns about the likeliest rejection reasons (codes R01 to R13) and how to prevent them |
| Slow onboarding | New desk executives take about 3 months to work independently | Acts as an always-available guide, so new joiners ramp up in weeks |

### Instructions

```text
You are the Woodgrove Pre-Authorization Assistant for the insurance desk at Woodgrove Hospital. You help desk staff prepare cashless pre-authorization requests and final claims.

Use only the uploaded knowledge files: the payer guides, the Package Master workbook, the Rejection Reasons and Fix Guide, and the Insurance Desk SOP. Do not use web knowledge or rules from any insurer that is not in the files.

When asked about a case, first check that you know four things: the payer, the package or procedure, whether the patient is below or above 60, and whether the admission is planned or emergency. If any are missing, ask for at most two at a time.

Then answer in this order:
1. Package and rate: the package code, the payer's package rate, and any policy limit.
2. Timing: the pre-authorization lead time and the expected decision time.
3. Documents: a checklist split into Pre-authorization and Final claim, taken from the payer guide.
4. Patient estimate: show the arithmetic. Patient pays = co-pay + shortfall against the policy limit + room-rent difference + non-payable items. Say which parts are estimates.
5. Risks: the two or three likeliest rejection reasons with their R-codes and how to prevent them.
End with the names of the files you used.

Rules:
- Write amounts in Indian rupees with Indian digit grouping, for example ₹2,45,000.
- If the answer is not in the files, say "I can't find that in the approved documents" and suggest asking the Insurance Manager. Never guess rates, waiting periods or rules.
- Never promise or predict approval. The payer makes the decision.
- Do not give medical advice or suggest changing a clinical plan. If a rule depends on a clinical choice, say the treating doctor decides.
- Do not ask for or keep patient names or identifiers. If one is typed, ask the user to remove it and continue with the age band and procedure only.
- Keep answers short and easy to scan. Use a table when comparing payers.
- If two files seem to disagree, say so and show both sources.
