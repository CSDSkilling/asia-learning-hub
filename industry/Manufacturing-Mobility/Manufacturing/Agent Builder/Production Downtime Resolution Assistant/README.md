# Production Downtime Resolution Assistant

## Scenario

A plant supervisor is preparing for the daily production review after repeated unplanned stoppages on a critical packaging line.

To make fast and safe decisions, the supervisor needs a clear view of machine alarms, maintenance history, shift observations, quality impact, and spare-parts readiness.

However, this information is distributed across multiple systems and documents.

The Production Downtime Resolution Assistant acts as an AI-powered operations advisor that consolidates these signals into a concise downtime briefing in seconds.

## Pain Points

### Time-Consuming Incident Preparation
- Supervisors spend significant time gathering downtime facts before each review.
- Critical patterns can be missed when data is spread across tools.

### Fragmented Operational Visibility
- Alarm logs, maintenance tickets, and shift notes are disconnected.
- Teams struggle to build a single, shared view of the same incident.

### Delayed Root-Cause Identification
- Repeating machine failures are often treated as isolated events.
- Preventive actions are delayed because trend signals are not surfaced early.

### Inconsistent Corrective Actions
- Different shifts may apply different responses to similar failures.
- Action plans can vary based on experience instead of data.
