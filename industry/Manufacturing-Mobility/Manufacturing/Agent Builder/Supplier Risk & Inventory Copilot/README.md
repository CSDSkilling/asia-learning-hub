# Supplier Risk & Inventory Copilot

## Scenario

A procurement manager is preparing for a weekly supply assurance review to prevent production disruptions caused by delayed deliveries and incoming quality failures.

To make the right call quickly, the team needs visibility into open purchase orders, supplier SLA performance, quality rejections, and material criticality by line.

However, this information is spread across multiple systems and reports.

The Supplier Risk & Inventory Copilot acts as an AI-powered advisor that combines these data points and provides a risk-prioritized mitigation plan in seconds.

## Pain Points

### Time-Consuming Risk Assessment
- Procurement teams spend significant time compiling risk signals before each review.
- Critical supply threats may be discovered too late for effective mitigation.

### Fragmented Supplier Visibility
- PO status, quality rejections, and scorecards are maintained in separate systems.
- Teams struggle to get a consolidated supplier risk perspective.

### Preventable Stockouts and Line Risk
- Delayed and non-conforming materials can trigger avoidable production downtime.
- Material criticality is not always linked to real line impact.

### Inconsistent Mitigation Prioritization
- Expedite and alternate-source decisions vary by individual judgment.
- No consistent, data-driven ranking of immediate actions.
